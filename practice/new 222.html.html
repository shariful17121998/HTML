			<em>Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Zafrullah Chowdhury suggested constructing the Kalabagan police station at home minister</em><br/>
			<strong>Asaduzzaman Khan’s</strong> residence if no other place is available.<br/>
			He made this proposition during a protest against the construction of a police station at Kalabagan’s Tentultala ground on Wednesday.
		<br/><br/>
			<strong>Zafrullah Chowdhury said,</strong><mark>“If no other plot is found for constructing the police station,</mark><strong>honourable home minister</strong>,<br/>
			please give some land from your home. This will only boost your reputation. If there’s no land available,</br>
			then acquire four-five floors of the multistoried building adjacent to it (Tentultala ground) and construct the police station there.”
		<br/><br/>
			<u>Saying that the Tentultala ground acts as the “lungs of the children, lungs of the elderly”,</u><strong>Zafrullah Chowdhury further said,</strong><br/>
			“We can’t allow this lung to be taken away. We will not accept any unfair order to construct a police station on it.<br/>
			The bricks and concrete have to be removed. Otherwise, we will set camp right here.
		</hr>
			Zafrullah Chowdhury also called for a movement against it,<br/>“We can’t return home until our demands are met.<br/>
			Collectively, we will defend the ground. I will join you all in the movement to remove the walls, bricks and cement from the ground.”
